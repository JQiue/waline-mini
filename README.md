# waline-mini

> A lightweight Waline comment system implemented in Rust

## Introduction

waline-mini is a Rust implementation of the Waline comment system. Compared to the Node.js version, it only uses 1/100 of the memory, making it ideal for environments with limited server memory.

Although the functionality is not yet complete, the goal of waline-mini is not to completely replace the original Waline, but to provide a more lightweight and efficient alternative.

## Features

+ Extremely low memory usage: Only uses 1/100 of the memory compared to the Node.js version.
+ Fast response: Built with Rust, providing excellent performance.
+ Easy to use: Offers similar APIs to the original Waline, making it easy to integrate and use.
+ Continual updates: Will be updated regularly to improve functionality and keep up with the development of Waline.
